# Function
This example introduces how to set OPL1000 IO peripheral to UART port.  In the demo only one UART port is defined. UART0 works at simple mode (2 signals, IO10, IO11 pins). 

In order to run this demo external UART device connection is required. 

# Notes
- UART resource and work mode can be set by PinMux tool. 
- PinMux tool is provided under Tool\PinMux folder. 
- Refer Doc\OPL1000-pinmux-tool-user-guide.pdf to know how to use PinMux tool.
